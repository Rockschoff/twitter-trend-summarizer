Photo Gallery Kansas basketball v. Chaminade Images from Monday night's game between the Jayhawks and Silverswords during the first-round game of the Maui Invitational.

Manning has tangible evidence that what he's doing at Wake Forest is working. Wake fans are pumped. In many ways, this was the biggest win Wake Forest has had since their 2010 NCAA Tournament victory over Texas. I won't jump to conclusions about where this season can go, but I"m very excited with what Wake has accomplished without Codi and Cornelius

The whole thing is made a little easier, at least for Manning and his family, by the fact that Kansas, with Manning's son Evan in uniform, and Wake Forest are on opposite sides of the tournament bracket and likely would only meet if both were to advance to Wednesday's championship game.

Wake Forest scored the first two points of the second half to take a 52-45 lead, but Indiana responded with a 9-0 to go up 54-52 at the under-16 timeout.
