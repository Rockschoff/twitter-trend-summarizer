HBO's medieval saga Game of Thrones is known for serving up graphic deaths of its lead characters, but when fan favourite Jon Snow was killed off, avid followers speculated every theory and sighting that would bring back their heroic soldier.

Featuring a wounded, bloody Snow, the poster quickly made its rounds on the Internet Monday, leading many to the hopeful conclusion that Kit Harrington's character survived murder in the season five finale.

Here's the same series suggesting that what we saw - Jon Snow bleeding out in the snow - was merely a feint, a trick, a "Game" game.

A second noted: Jon Snow really can't be dead, he has so much to learn. After all, Jon Snow knows nothing.

Since that fateful scene, there have been plenty of rumours to suggest that, somehow, he will defeat death.
