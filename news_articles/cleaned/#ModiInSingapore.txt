India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi will make an official visit to Singapore at the invitation of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a statement today, Nov 22

When Singapore's founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew died in March, Modi ordered flags in India to be flown at half-mast as a mark of respect to Mr Lee.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will arrive in Singapore tomorrow on a two-day official visit at the invitation of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, during which both countries will elevate ties to a Strategic Partnership.

Singapore's success is indeed noteworthy. Their achievements in urban development, urban transport, waste management, development of ports and skill development are well known. My visit to Singapore will focus on these key areas of India-Singapore cooperation.

In 2013, foreign direct investment from India into Singapore was S$23.7 billion, nearly twice Singapore's direct investment to India of S$12.1 billion.
