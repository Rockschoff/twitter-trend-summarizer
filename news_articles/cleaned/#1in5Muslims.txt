He added: The hashtag was a fun way to show Muslims coming together to set the record straight but also to show the light hearted and fun in way to laugh off such ridiculous claims. The message was clear - you try to sensationalise and stigmatise a community then people power will rise up and set the record straight.

According to reports, the polling firm Survation, which conducted the poll on behalf of "The Sun" contacted 1,500 people from their database with "Muslim sounding names" and then asked them if they identified as such before continuing with the poll - other pollsters criticize the method as lacking sufficient socioeconomic and demographic details in order to represent a true sampling of the British Muslim population.

The methodology used by The Sun's polling company also may have failed to properly identify Muslims, because the pollster targeted people who supposedly had easily identifiable Muslim surnames.

Twitter is having a field day right now with its trending hashtag response to a British tabloid which made a seemingly grossly exaggerated claim about the percentage of Islamic citizens who have Sympathy for jihadis.
