Manning has tangible evidence that what he's doing at Wake Forest is working. Wake fans are pumped. In many ways, this was the biggest win Wake Forest has had since their 2010 NCAA Tournament victory over Texas. I won't jump to conclusions about where this season can go, but I"m very excited with what Wake has accomplished without Codi and Cornelius
Great win for Danny Manning and his Wake Forest squad Guy can coach He is the reason Tulsa is good now as well
Danny Manning has a solid team I am impressed
