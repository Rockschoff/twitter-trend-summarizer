Researcher who helped conduct the poll is shocked at how the Sun exploited it
The Sun story prompts humorous Twitter response
Twitter is having a field day right now with its trending hashtag response to a British tabloid which made a seemingly grossly exaggerated claim about the percentage of Islamic citizens who have Sympathy for jihadis.
He added: The hashtag was a fun way to show Muslims coming together to set the record straight but also to show the light hearted and fun in way to laugh off such ridiculous claims. The message was clear - you try to sensationalise and stigmatise a community then people power will rise up and set the record straight.
