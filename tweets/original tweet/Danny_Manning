Forgot Danny Manning coached.

@BootsMcGuinness Whoa! I didn't even know Danny Manning was doing anything. Glad to hear that.

Forgot my guy Danny Manning was coaching Wake Forest. Good for him

don't like the job Danny Manning's doing w/@WakeForest. 2 7'ers &amp; he's trying to run and gun with a smaller team... now Devin Thomas is hurt

Danny Manning is a bad coach.
